Adds custom user-defined links to the bottom of the Site Name menu in the WP admin toolbar on the front-end view.

## Description

This plugin allows administrators to easily add up to five custom links to the WordPress admin toolbar. Specifically, these links will appear in the dropdown menu under the site's name when viewing the front end of the website while logged in. This provides quick access to frequently used admin pages or any other URLs.

The first two links are pre-populated with "Posts" (`/wp-admin/edit.php`) and "Pages" (`/wp-admin/edit.php?post_type=page`) upon plugin activation, but all links are fully customizable via a settings page.

## Installation

1.  Upload the `kiss-wp-admin-menu-useful-links` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory on your WordPress installation.
2.  Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
3.  Alternatively, upload the plugin's ZIP file directly via the 'Plugins' > 'Add New' > 'Upload Plugin' page in your WordPress admin area.

## Usage

1.  After activating the plugin, navigate to **Settings > KISS Useful Links** in your WordPress admin dashboard.
2.  You will find fields to enter up to 5 custom link labels and their corresponding URLs.
    * **Label:** The text that will be displayed for the link.
    * **URL:** The destination URL. This can be a relative path (e.g., `/wp-admin/users.php`) or a full URL (e.g., `https://example.com/my-page`).
3.  Enter your desired labels and URLs.
4.  Click the "Save Links" button.
5.  Visit the front end of your website while logged in. Hover over your site name in the admin toolbar (top-left) to see your custom links added to the menu.
